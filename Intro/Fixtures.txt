Intro:
    Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to which it is applied. 
    Fixtures are used to feed some data to the tests such as database connections, 
    URLs to test and some sort of input data. Therefore, instead of running the same 
    code for every test, we can attach fixture function to the tests and it will run and return 
    the data to the test before executing each test.
