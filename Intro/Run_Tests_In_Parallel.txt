Intro:
    By default, pytest runs tests in sequential order. In a real scenario, a test suite will 
    have a number of test files and each file will have a bunch of tests. This will lead to a 
    large execution time. To overcome this, pytest provides us with an option to run tests in parallel.

    For this, we need to first install the pytest-xdist plugin.

    Install pytest-xdist by running the following command âˆ’

    pip install pytest-xdist
    Now, we can run tests by using the syntax pytest -n <num>

    eg: pytest -n 3
