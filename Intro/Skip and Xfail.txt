Intro:
    Pytest will execute the xfailed test, but it will not be considered as part failed or passed tests. 
    Details of these tests will not be printed even if the test fails (remember pytest usually 
    prints the failed test details). 
    We can xfail tests using the following marker −
        @pytest.mark.xfail

    Skipping a test means that the test will not be executed. 
    We can skip tests using the following marker −
        @pytest.mark.skip
