Intro:
    In a real scenario, once a new version of the code is ready to deploy, it is first deployed
    into pre-prod/ staging environment. Then a test suite runs on it.

    The code is qualified for deploying to production only if the test suite passes. 
    If there is test failure, whether it is one or many, the code is not production ready.

    Therefore, what if we want to stop the execution of test suite soon after n number of test fails. 
    This can be done in pytest using maxfail.

    The syntax to stop the execution of test suite soon after n number of test fails is as follows âˆ’
    pytest --maxfail = <num>
    eg: pytest test_maxfail.py -v --maxfail 1
